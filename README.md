# Candidate Search Challenge - LJ

## Description
This project is a **React + TypeScript** application developed as part of a coding challenge. It demonstrates core front-end concepts including **API integration**, **component-based design**, **state management**, and **localStorage**. The goal of this challenge was to build a dynamic interface that pulls data from GitHub's public API, allows users to interact with candidates, and persist selections across sessions.
